# 💻 Software Engineering Projects

Just getting started over here, but trust, the tools I build go *hard*. From automation to app analysis, these projects show I don’t just code things... I engineer solutions that do the most with the least.

### 📱 [Android APK Static Analyzer ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/apk-static-analyzer)

Reverse engineered an Android app like it owed me money 💅. This CLI tool digs into APKs and pulls out **permissions, services, receivers**, and other hidden gems. Perfect for security nerds, mobile devs, or anyone who loves catching red flags in raw code.
